# What does this program do?

This program gives one the ability to create a *Perfectly Secure Crypto System*. Utilizing One-Time-Pad the user has the ability to either encypt or decrypt a message using the aformentioned protocol. If the user chooses to encrypt a message the program will first take an input (the message) from the user and generate a unique key. It will then convert the key and message to binary and perform the XOR sequence. Afterwards the program will print out the "Encrypted" binary cipher. Else if the user is seeaking to decrypt a message, the user will have to enter the key and each binarycipher (in groups of 8) one by one. Then, the program will conduct the XOR sequence on the binarykey and cipher, while printing the decoded binary. Then the user **MUST**, input 0b plus the previously printed value. 
## Known Limitations

- When the program prints out the encrypted binary, the user must remove all whitespaces and separate the binary into blocks of 8
- When trying to decrypt the message, the user must input the binary cipher one by one
- While trying to decrypt, when the program prints the binary message. The user must input 0b + the given binary message to print out the corresponding character.

## How to Run it?

1. First, run the [One-Time-Pad](https://repl.it/Gb6Q/0) program
2. Then just follow the instructions within the program
3. Enjoy and have fun :)

**Note: While decrypting you must remove all the whitespaces of the encrypted binary code and sepate them into blocks of 8**
